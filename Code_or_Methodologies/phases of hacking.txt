Phases of Hacking:

1.Information Gathering- Collecting information about the target
2.Exploitation-gain access to target machine at a basic level (CLI)
3.Privilege Escalation-escalating user's privilege from lower-level access to higher-level access
4.Creating Backdoor-maintaining access of the victim by creating a backdoor.
5.Clearing the Tracks -wipe out all the logs captured by the system to avoid being caught
