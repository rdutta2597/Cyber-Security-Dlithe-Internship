DOS attack and a few commands on it
It's an Attack where hacker freezes / makes the target computer inaccessible
to the Legitimate user through DOS vulnerability or through flooding with
malicious packets.
DOS(Denial Of Service) -1 attacker to 1 server
DDOS(Distributed Denial Of Service)-Multiple attacker to 1 server attacker{more} = server{less}
Ping of death-By increasing the size of packet sent in ping
Command:ping <target-ip> -s <size of the packet> -l (in windows)
eg: ping <ip_address> -s <packet_size> / -l <packet_size>
eg: ping 192.168.1.101 -s (unix) 65000
eg: ping 192.168.1.101 -l (windows) 65000
ICMP-can be used to block on the servers
32 or 64 bytes
600bytes
Protocol Based
RFC Standards the waiting period for ACK after sending SYN+ACK 1 min
1 packets = 1 min
100 packets = 100 min

Syn flood- continuously sending an only syn requests to the open port
hping3 -S -p 80 www.goodshopping.com
Command:hping3 -S -p <port number> <target-ip> - flood
TCP Ping = Half Open Scan only set Syn flag and send the packet to open port of the target

Some Common Ways to Defend Against DOS attacks.
1. Keep all your machines, patched up to date.
2. Sensing the traffic(Firewall) & blacklisting
3. Load Balancer
4. Content Distributed Network
5. Blackhole
Time To Live: Specifies the age of that specific packet
